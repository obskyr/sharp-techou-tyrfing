# The Sharp Techō Tyrfing

The Sharp Techō Tyrfing&nbsp;– a **breakout board for the cartridge slot of** [**Sharp’s **SC Denshi System Techō** line of late-’80s-to-early-’90s PDAs**](https://forums.insertcredit.com/t/stay-sharp-with-sc-denshi-system-techo-games/2326). (Also licensed to other companies&nbsp;– the “Sharp” in the name of this project only coyly alludes to the company name, but formally, it means that this sword-lookin’ PCB is *sharp,* baby. It should fit in SC Denshi System Techō devices by other companies as well!)

The BOM is simple:

* A 45-position single-row female SMD pin header with 1-mm pitch (difficult to find, but a cuttable 50-position one may be available&nbsp;– or do as I did and use two [20-position ones](https://www.digikey.se/short/rdtnbf29) and one [5-position one](https://www.digikey.se/short/3pb4vt48))
* A 45-position single-row male SMD pin header with 1-mm pitch (difficult to find, but a cuttable 50-position one may be available&nbsp;– or do as I did and use two [20-position ones](https://www.digikey.se/short/3jd777nn) and one [5-position one](https://www.digikey.se/short/nfp4mr47))
* A [50-position two-row IDC connector](https://www.digikey.se/short/5dqqh2z7) or [50-position male through-hole pin header with 2.54-mm pitch](https://www.digikey.se/short/1vptfzbh) (and you may want to get [an IDC cable to match](https://www.digikey.se/short/q9n8nwvb))

Worth noting is that the Sharp Techō Tyrfing must be manufactured as a **0.6 mm thick PCB**&nbsp;– otherwise it won’t fit quite right in the machine.

Naturally, feel more than free to contact me with any questions!
